Basically,in our program users are having options of reading and writing the notes.
If someone wanna read the notes then the user can sipmly chose the option of reading
and he will get the notes according to his needs ex...like in our program we have 
provided the notes of different-different programming languages such as java,python,
C and C++ . So, suppose if he is looking for python notes then he will get those notes 
through our program and similarly if the user wanna rewrite the notes then he can do so
in the same way by choosing the writing option !
